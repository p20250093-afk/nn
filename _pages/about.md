I have received my Ph.D. degree in Photonics Science and Engineering from the Indian
Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India, in 2023.
I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and
Electronics Engineering at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani
Hyderabad Campus. Prior to my current position, I had an opportunity to work as a
Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Prof. Ranjan Singh&#39;s research group at the Centre for
Disruptive Photonic Technologies, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
Before that, in 2023, I served as a Project Scientist with the Centre for Nanoscience and
Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India. Back in 2010, after my
undergraduate studies, I went on to gain professional experience with the core sector
manufacturing industries and joined Jindal Steel &amp; Power Ltd. (JSPL). After a brief stint at
JSPL, I joined NTPC Ltd. (a Govt. of India Maharatna PSU) in 2011 and served there in the
capacity of Deputy Manager till 2017. Thereafter, moved back to academics and joined the
Ph.D. program at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India, in 2017. My Ph.D.
thesis on dispersion-engineered sub-wavelength and surface states was conferred with an
Outstanding Ph.D. Thesis Award by IIT Kanpur in its 56th Convocation. It has also received
the Best PhD Thesis award from the Indian Laser Association in DAE-BRNS National Laser
Symposium-32.
